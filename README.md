# DataSets

[![Build Status](https://github.com/c42f/DataSets.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c42f/DataSets.jl/actions)

DataSets.jl solves these problems:

* **Describe dataset format and location** with a declarative format designed
  for both local and remote data storage.
* **Record data provenance** to understand the source of your old data.
* **Version** your mutable data sets in a flexible and lightweight way.
* **Partition** data using **indices** for incremental and distributed processing.
* **Decouple dataset IO from data processing**. Collaborate on decoders
  under a common interface (somewhat like a generalized FileIO.jl).
